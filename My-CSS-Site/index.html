            <h3>PYTHON</h3>
            <p>I have been learning Python since 2 years. I have made many projects using Python and I have been learning automation in python. Using Automation in python I have been bulding a lot of stuff. Recently I have also started Machine Learning as I was fascinated about it that how machines can mimic humans. So I am following my interest and been working on some projects using ML.</p>
